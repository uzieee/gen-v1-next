2. Modify some fields (e.g., topic, description)
3. Click "Update Roundtable"

**Expected Result:**
- Form should populate with existing data
- Changes should be saved successfully
- Updated data should appear in the table

#### Test 2.4: Delete Roundtable
**Steps:**
1. Click "Delete" on a test roundtable
2. Confirm the deletion in the browser prompt

**Expected Result:**
- Confirmation dialog should appear
- Roundtable should be removed from the table
- No error messages should appear

### 3. Database Integration Testing

#### Test 3.1: Verify Ice Breaker Data Storage
**Steps:**
1. Open MongoDB Compass or your preferred MongoDB client
2. Connect to the database: `mongodb://localhost:27017/gen-v1-next`
3. Navigate to the `users` collection
4. Find a user document and check the `iceBreakers` field

**Expected Result:**
- `iceBreakers` field should contain:
  - `currentIceBreaker`: Current ice breaker text
  - `iceBreakerHistory`: Array of previous ice breakers
  - `iceBreakerPreferences`: User preferences for style and topics

#### Test 3.2: Verify Roundtable Data Storage
**Steps:**
1. In MongoDB Compass, navigate to the `roundtables` collection
2. Check for documents created during testing
